There are a lot of related work that reviewed the
reinforcement learning in strategy-based and atari games. Arulkumaran et
al\cite{I9} make a brief introduction of DRL, covering central algorithms and
presenting a range of visual RL domains Zhao et al.\cite{I10} and Tang et
al.\cite{I11} survey the development of DRL research, and focus on AlphaGo and
AlphaGo Zero models. Shao et al.\cite{I12} review the development of DRL in
game AI, from 2D to 3D, and from single-agent to multi-agent, and discuss the
real-time strategy games.\\ In this paper, we will discuss the development that
Google DeepMind made in developing AI models for games and the advancments. The
main contribution will be the comprehensive details of the three models
AlphaGo, AlphaGo Zero, and MuZero, focusing on the challenges that each model
faced and the improvements that were made. Also we will discuss the advancments
in these three AI models, reaching to the future directions.
